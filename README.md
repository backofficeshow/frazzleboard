Muti output retro computer linear PSU

The idea of this board is a general linear PSU for retro computers

It should be ok for audio applications, please check the required capacitor values.

Thanks to everyone on the stream and the James Bearss for checking out the design.

It shouldnt electrocute you, but it might, so be safe and be aware of the risks!

Lots of Love

Dr A!
